# email_spam_classifier



##Introduction
-Spam detection is a classification problem, where we want to train a model to predict whether an email is spam or not. Linear regression is a regression algorithm, which is typically used for predicting continuous values. However, it is possible to use linear regression for classification problems by converting the target variable (spam/not spam) to a continuous value.

##Data preparation
-The first step is to prepare the data. This involves cleaning the data, removing any unnecessary features, and converting the target variable to a continuous value.

-One way to convert the target variable to a continuous value is to use a sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is a non-linear function that maps values between 0 and 1. We can use the sigmoid function to map the spam/not spam labels to values between 0 and 1, where 0 represents not spam and 1 represents spam.

-Another way to convert the target variable to a continuous value is to use one-hot encoding. One-hot encoding is a technique used to represent categorical variables as binary features. In the context of spam detection, we can use one-hot encoding to represent the spam/not spam labels as two binary features, one for spam and one for not spam.

##Feature engineering
-Once the data has been prepared, we can start to engineer features. Feature engineering is the process of transforming the data into features that are more informative for the machine learning model.

-Some common features used for spam detection include:

-The number of words in the email
-The number of punctuation marks in the email
-The number of capital letters in the email
-The presence of certain keywords, such as "free" and "viagra"
-The presence of certain email addresses, such as those known to be used by spammers

##Model training
-Once the features have been engineered, we can start to train the linear regression model. We can use any standard linear regression algorithm, such as the one implemented in the scikit-learn library.

##Model evaluation
-Once the model has been trained, we can evaluate its performance on a held-out test set. This will give us an idea of how well the model will generalize to new data.

##Model deployment
-Once we are satisfied with the performance of the model, we can deploy it to production. This means making the model available to users so that they can use it to predict whether new emails are spam or not.

##Conclusion
-Linear regression can be used for email spam detection, but it is important to note that it is not the best algorithm for this task. There are other algorithms, such as logistic regression and support vector machines, that are better suited for classification problems. However, linear regression can be a good starting point for beginners, as it is a relatively simple algorithm to understand and implement.
